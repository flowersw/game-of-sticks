#This game is not happening for me tonight. I have no good excuses, except
#My mom's birthday was tonight. I'm learning that I can't really schedule
#anything during the week, which is fine, just an adjustment(and one that I
#should have known coming in). So, this assignment will be late. Thus far, I
#copied the pig game we worked on today into the docs, and was trying to figure
#out the differences between them (Which probly isn't too many). I do apologize
#for this, and don't intend to make it a regular habit. Let me know if we need
#talk. I'll plan to re-submit it ASAP (probly tomorrow at some point)
